 ### üßæ Plain Summary
The lecture focused on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a framework designed to simplify the integration of large language models with external tools such as Google Drive, SQL databases, and APIs. The MCP server hosts various tools that can perform specific tasks, while the MCP client interacts with these servers via a standardized protocol. This approach eliminates the need for custom code development for each tool and model, enhancing interoperability. Key takeaways include understanding how to set up an MCP server using Python SDKs, configuring clients like Cloud Desktop or Cursor to connect with MCP servers, building custom tools that interact with APIs such as GitHub, and utilizing MCP Inspector for testing and debugging.

# Model Context Protocol (MCP): A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction to MCP
**MCP**, or **Model Context Protocol**, is a framework aimed at simplifying the integration of large language models (LLMs) with external tools. It acts as a 'USB port for tools', allowing LLMs to interact seamlessly with various applications and services through a standardized protocol.

### Key Components:
- **Tools**: Functions that perform specific tasks, such as adding two numbers or fetching weather information.
- **Resources**: Endpoints providing data or information, similar to GET endpoints in APIs.
- **Prompts**: Reusable templates for interactions with LLMs and tools.

## MCP Server Architecture and Components
The MCP server consists of three main components:
1. **Tools**: Abstracted functions performing specific tasks.
2. **Resources**: Data endpoints accessed by LLMs.
3. **Prompts**: Templates facilitating interactions between LLMs and tools.

### Setting Up an MCP Server
Using the FastMCP framework, you can define tools, resources, and prompts in Python:
```python
from mcp.server.fast import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="mcp-demo")

@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```
Run the server using `uvicorn` for local testing.

## Building MCP Clients
Clients like Cloud Desktop or Cursor can be configured to connect with MCP servers. Ensure paths and commands are correctly configured, especially when dealing with personal access tokens.

### Example Configuration:
For Cloud Desktop:
```json
{
  "name": "mcp-demo",
  "command": "/usr/local/bin/uv",
  "args": ["run", "main.py"],
  "transport": "stdio"
}
```

## Implementing Custom MCP Servers
Custom servers can be built to interact with specific APIs, such as GitHub:
- **Tools**: Define functions that call API endpoints using personal access tokens.
- **Authorization**: Handle authorization by passing tokens in requests.

### Example Tool:
```python
@mcp.tool
def list_repositories(username: str) -> list:
    url = f"https://api.github.com/users/{username}/repos"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()  # List of repos
```

## Testing MCP Servers
Use the **MCP Inspector** to test and debug MCP servers through a UI, listing tools, resources, and responses. Ensure paths and commands are correctly configured for optimal performance.

### Example Command:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
```

## Building MCP Clients Using Langchain MCP Adapters
Utilize the **Langchain MCP Adapters** in Python to build custom MCP clients, fetching tools from MCP servers and wrapping them into a Langchain agent for intelligent decision-making based on queries.

### Example Setup:
```python
from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient

client = MultiServerMCPClient(mcp_servers=[
    {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "main.py"],
      "transport": "stdio"
    }
])
```

## Practical Tips and Considerations for MCP Integration
- Ensure the MCP server is running before connecting clients.
- Correctly configure paths, commands, and handle personal access tokens with appropriate scopes.
- Restart clients after configuration changes to reload MCP server information.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively utilize MCP servers to provide rich contextual information to LLMs, enhancing their ability to respond intelligently and contextually aware queries.

### üõ†Ô∏è Practical Setup & Code Snippets
- **Setting Up an MCP Server**:
  ```python
  from mcp.server.fast import FastMCP

  mcp = FastMCP(name="mcp-demo")

  @mcp.tool
  def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
      return a + b

      import uvicorn
      uvicorn.run(mcp.app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)
  ```
- **Building an MCP Client**:
  ```python
  from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient

  client = MultiServerMCPClient(mcp_servers=[
      {
        "command": "uv",
        "args": ["run", "main.py"],
        "transport": "stdio"
      }
  ])
  ```
