### Improved Summary

# Machine Learning Concepts

## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training a model with labeled data, where the desired output is known beforehand. It includes techniques like classification and regression used for predicting outcomes based on input features.

### Key Techniques:
- **Classification**: Predicts categorical labels (e.g., spam or not spam).
- **Regression**: Predicts continuous values (e.g., house prices).

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, focusing on finding patterns and structures within the dataset without predefined categories.

### Key Techniques:
- **Clustering**: Groups similar data points together based on feature similarity.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Simplifies complex datasets by reducing the number of features while retaining important information.

## Practical Applications
The lecture provided practical examples using Python libraries such as scikit-learn to demonstrate these concepts:
- **K-Means Clustering**: Utilizes distance metrics to group data points into clusters, useful for market segmentation and anomaly detection.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a hierarchy of clusters without specifying the number of groups, suitable for exploratory analysis.
- **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**: Simplifies high-dimensional datasets by focusing on principal components that capture most variance in data.

### Mathematical Models:
- **Decision Boundary**: For classification tasks, defines how inputs are mapped to outputs using weights and bias terms.
- **Euclidean Distance**: Used in clustering algorithms to measure similarity between points based on their features.

## Code Snippets
```python
# K-Means Clustering Example
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

X = np.array([[1, 1], [1.5, 2], [5, 8], [8, 8]])
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2)
kmeans.fit(X)
print('Centroids:', kmeans.cluster_centers_)
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=kmeans.labels_, cmap='rainbow')
plt.show()
```
This code snippet demonstrates how to use K-Means clustering on a dataset of points, identifying two clusters and plotting them accordingly.
