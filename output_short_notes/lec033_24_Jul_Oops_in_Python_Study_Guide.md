 ### üßæ Plain Summary
This lecture covered the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, including classes, objects, instance variables, class variables, methods, getters, setters, class methods, and encapsulation. It also introduced various data structures from the `collections` module such as sets, defaultdicts, Counters, and deques. The lecture provided practical examples to illustrate these concepts, like a bank account management system and an employee database using classes with shared attributes and individual instances.

# Object-Oriented Programming in Python

## Major Topics
1. **Classes and Objects**
   - A class is a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of the class.
   - The `__init__` method initializes object attributes.
   
2. **Instance vs Class Variables**
   - Instance variables are unique to each object; class variables are shared among all instances of the class.

3. **Methods**
   - Methods are functions defined within a class that operate on object data, with `self` referring to the instance.

4. **Encapsulation**
   - Encapsulation is achieved using getters and setters to control access and modification of attributes.

5. **Class Methods**
   - Class methods are bound to the class and can modify class-level variables or serve as alternative constructors.

6. **Collections Module**
   - Includes `set`, `defaultdict`, `Counter`, and `deque` for specialized data handling.

## Key Flow
The lecture started with defining a class and creating objects from it. It then moved on to discuss instance variables, which are unique to each object, and class variables, shared among all instances of the class. The concept of methods was introduced, focusing on how they operate on object data through `self`. Encapsulation was explained using getter and setter methods for controlled attribute access and modification.

## Important Concepts
- **Class**: A blueprint or template for creating objects that defines a set of attributes and methods.
- **Object**: An instance of a class, which can have its own unique values for the class's properties (attributes).
- **Instance Variable**: A variable that belongs to an instance of a class; it is unique to each object created from the class.
- **Class Variable**: A variable that is shared among all instances of a class and defined within the class but outside any instance methods.
- **Method**: A function associated with a class, which operates on its data members (instance variables).
- **Getter**: A method used to get the value of an attribute; often encapsulated for controlled access.
- **Setter**: A method used to set or modify the value of an attribute; can include validation logic.
- **Class Method**: A method that operates on the class itself rather than its instances, conventionally named `cls`.
- **Encapsulation**: The practice of hiding implementation details within a class and exposing only necessary interfaces for interaction.

## Interview-style Questions & Answers
1. What is the difference between an instance variable and a class variable?
   - Instance variables are unique to each object, while class variables are shared among all instances of the class.
   
2. How do you define a method in a Python class?
   - Methods are defined within a class using the `def` keyword, with `self` as the first parameter referring to the instance.

3. Explain how encapsulation is achieved in Python using getters and setters.
   - Getters are used to retrieve values from an object's attributes, while setters modify these attributes, often including validation logic.

4. What is a class method? Provide an example.
   - A class method operates on the class itself rather than its instances; it can be defined using `@classmethod`. Example: `@classmethod def set_tax(cls, value): cls.tax = value`.

5. How do you use the collections module in Python for data structures?
   - The collections module provides specialized container datatypes that are more efficient and convenient than their general purpose built-in counterparts like lists or dictionaries.
