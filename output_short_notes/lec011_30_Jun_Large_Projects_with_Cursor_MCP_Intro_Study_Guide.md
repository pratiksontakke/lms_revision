 ### 🧾 Plain Summary
This lecture focused on the Model-Centric Protocol (MCP), a standardized way to connect AI applications with external tools without writing custom integration code for each tool. The MCP architecture includes an MCP Client that runs on the AI application side and sends requests to an MCP Server, which in turn communicates with the actual external service API. This approach allows for easy multi-tool connections and provides benefits such as reusable code and easier integration across multiple APIs.

# Model-Centric Protocol (MCP) Lecture Summary

## Key Takeaways
- **MCP** is a protocol that simplifies the connection between AI applications and external tools by providing a common framework for communication without requiring custom integration code for each tool.
- The MCP architecture includes an **MCP Client** on the AI application side and an **MCP Server** that communicates with the external service API through standardized protocols.
- By using MCP, developers can achieve easier multi-tool connections and leverage reusable code across different APIs.

## Major Topics & Key Flow
### Architecture Overview
1. **MCP Client**: Runs on AI application side, sends requests to MCP Server following MCP protocols.
2. **MCP Server**: Exposes tools as functions that the AI applications can call via MCP.
3. **Communication Flow**: AI Application -> MCP Client -> MCP Server -> External API.
4. **Server Location**: Can be local or remote (hosted by external service provider).

### Benefits of MCP Protocol
- **Standardization**: Defines a common set of rules for communication between AI applications and external tools.
- **Code Reusability**: Developers write reusable code that can work with multiple APIs, only varying inputs and outputs.
- **Easy Integration**: No need for custom integration for every external tool; MCP servers expose standardized toolsets.

### Building an MCP Server with Python
1. **Initialize a Python project** using a package manager like uv.
2. **Install fast-mcp library**.
3. **Define an MCP server** with tools as functions using FastMCP decorators.
4. **Run the server locally or remotely**.

### Using MCP Server with AI Applications
- Configure client to run or access MCP server by providing a command or URL.
- The AI app sends computation requests via the MCP client, which executes the MCP server providing the tools and returns results.

### MCP Marketplace & Available Tools
- **MCP marketplace** allows sharing prompts and resources across AI applications and provides a broad variety of tools easily integrated.
- Example tools include Google Drive, Notion, Web Search, and various databases.

### Types of MCP Server Implementations
1. **Standard Input/Output (StdIO)**: Default type for local or simple setups.
2. **HTTP with Streaming (STTP)**: Useful for remote deployment or web-accessible MCP servers.

### Security Considerations in MCP
- Use only trusted and authorized MCP servers to avoid data leakage risks.
- Avoid using anonymous third-party servers without proper trust.

## Important Concepts
- **MCP** is a standardized protocol that connects AI applications with external tools without custom integration code for each tool.
- The architecture includes an **MCP Client** on the AI application side and an **MCP Server** that communicates with the external service API through standardized protocols.
- MCP servers can be local or remote, and they expose tools as functions that the AI applications can call via MCP.
- MCP provides benefits such as standardization, code reusability, and easier integration across multiple APIs.

## Interview-style Questions & Answers
1. **What is MCP?**  
   - MCP (Model-Centric Protocol) is a standardized way to connect AI applications with external tools without writing custom integration code for each tool.
2. **Explain the role of MCP Client and MCP Server in the architecture.**  
   - The **MCP Client** runs on the AI application side and sends requests to the **MCP Server** following MCP protocols. The **MCP Server** communicates with the actual external service API through standardized protocols.
3. **What are the benefits of using MCP?**  
   - Benefits include standardization, code reusability, and easier integration across multiple APIs without writing custom integration code for each tool.
4. **How do you build an MCP server in Python?**  
   - Initialize a Python project using a package manager like uv, install the fast-mcp library, define an MCP server with tools as functions using FastMCP decorators, and run the server locally or remotely.
5. **What is the difference between local and remote MCP servers?**  
   - Local servers run on the same machine or local network, while remote servers are hosted by external service providers and accessible over HTTP networks.
