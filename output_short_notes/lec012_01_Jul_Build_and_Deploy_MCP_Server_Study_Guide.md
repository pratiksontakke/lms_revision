 ### üßæ Plain Summary

This lecture provided a comprehensive overview of the Model-Centric Programming (MCP) framework, focusing on its practical implementation through a case study with Bitbucket's MCP server. Key takeaways include understanding how to set up an MCP server using Python's fast-mcp library, exposing vendor APIs as MCP tools, and utilizing environment variables for secure API access. The lecture also highlighted the importance of testing in MCP development, both manually and through automated scripts, and demonstrated how AI tools can be effectively used alongside MCP servers during wipe coding sessions.

# Model-Centric Programming (MCP): A Practical Guide with Bitbucket Case Study

## Key Concepts Explained

1. **MCP Server**: An MCP server exposes APIs/tools/prompts/resources in the MCP protocol format, built using libraries like fast-mcp. It converts vendor-specific APIs into MCP formats.
2. **MCP Client**: Used by client applications to consume MCP servers uniformly without worrying about vendor-specific implementation.
3. **Environment Variables**: Critical for securely storing credentials when accessing vendor APIs remotely. Local setup reduces risk but secure practices are still necessary.
4. **Testing in MCP Development**: Involves both manual and automated scripts to ensure tool performance, with AI tools proving valuable during wipe coding sessions.

## Practical Setup & Code Snippets

### Setting Up an MCP Server

```python
from fast_mcp import MCP

mcp = MCP(name="bitbucket", description="Bitbucket MCP server to manage repos and pull requests")

@mcp.tool()
def list_repositories():
    # Implementation for listing repositories
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run_async()
```

### Using MCP Client in AI Applications

```python
from fast_mcp import MCPClient

client = MCPClient(command="python", args=["bitbucket_mcp_server.py"])
response = client.list_repositories()
print(response)
```

## Important Concepts

- **MCP Server**: A server that exposes APIs/tools/prompts/resources in the MCP protocol format, built using libraries like fast-mcp.
- **MCP Client**: A client application used to consume MCP servers uniformly without worrying about vendor-specific implementation.
- **Environment Variables**: Used for securely storing credentials when accessing vendor APIs remotely.
- **Testing in MCP Development**: Involves both manual and automated scripts to ensure tool performance, with AI tools proving valuable during wipe coding sessions.

## Interview-style Questions & Answers

1. What is the role of environment variables in MCP server setup?
   - Environment variables are crucial for securely storing credentials when accessing vendor APIs remotely. They help prevent leaks by keeping sensitive information local or passed securely during deployment.
2. How can you ensure secure handling of credentials in an MCP server?
   - By using environment variables locally during development and ensuring they are stored securely before deploying the server.
3. What benefits do automated tests bring to MCP development?
   - Automated tests improve code quality by providing a reliable way to verify that tools perform as expected, even under multiple concurrent user requests.

## Misunderstood or Confusing Topics

- **MCP Server Setup**: Some might find the setup process confusing due to the need for both theoretical understanding and practical coding skills. However, breaking down the steps into manageable parts can alleviate this confusion.

This summary provides a clear overview of MCP concepts and their practical implementation, making it easier to understand and apply these principles in real-world scenarios.
