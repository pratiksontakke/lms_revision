 ### Plain Summary
This lecture focused on advanced techniques for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, particularly those capable of handling multi-modal documents containing both text and images. Key topics included extracting text and images from PDFs, summarizing image content using multi-modal language models, creating embeddings for both text and images, and integrating these elements into a vector store for querying. The lecture also covered practical applications using libraries like PyMuPDF and Unstructured, as well as potential trade-offs between OCR extraction and LLM summarization based on business requirements and budget constraints.
