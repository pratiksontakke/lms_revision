# Lecture Summary: Vector Embeddings in Semantic Search

## Major Topics & Key Flow
1. **Introduction to Vector Embeddings**
   - Conversion of text into vector embeddings for semantic search.
   - Use case example: matching user query with candidate resumes using embeddings.

2. **Chunking Documents for Efficient Retrieval**
   - Limitations of large documents and methods to split them into manageable chunks (e.g., recursive splitting).

3. **Advanced Retrieval Techniques: Re-ranking**
   - After initial similarity search, re-ranking retrieved documents using specialized models to improve accuracy.

4. **Extending RAG to Multimedia Data**
   - Transcribing audio and video into text for embedding and retrieval.
   - Example command for extracting audio from a video using FFmpeg.

## Core Definitions & Concepts
- **Vector Embeddings**: Transforming text or documents into numerical vectors representing semantic meaning, useful for similarity searches.
- **Chunking**: Dividing large documents into smaller parts to improve efficiency and relevance in retrieval systems.
- **Re-ranking**: Refining the order of retrieved documents using specialized models that consider deeper semantic signals.
- **Multimodal RAG**: Expanding retrieval augmented generation capabilities to include audio and video content by transcribing and embedding them for search and query response.

## Interview-style Questions & Answers
1. **What is the role of vector embeddings in semantic search?**
   - Vector embeddings map text or documents into high-dimensional vectors that capture their semantic meaning, allowing for accurate similarity searches based on these semantic similarities.

2. **How do you handle large documents within retrieval systems?**
   - Large documents are divided into smaller chunks (e.g., by recursive splitting) to ensure efficient processing and relevant retrieval without losing important information.

3. **Explain the process of re-ranking after initial similarity search.**
   - After retrieving top N documents using vector search, a specialized re-ranking model processes these documents alongside the query, assigning new relevance scores that consider more nuanced semantic signals.

4. **How can you apply RAG to multimedia data?**
   - Multimedia data like audio and video is transcribed into text for embedding and retrieval. Metadata such as timestamps helps link answers back to specific parts of the media content.

## Important Concepts
- **Vector Embeddings**: Transforming textual data into numerical vectors that represent semantic meanings, facilitating similarity searches.
- **Chunking**: Breaking down large documents into smaller units (e.g., paragraphs or sentences) for efficient processing and retrieval.
- **Re-ranking**: Refining the list of retrieved documents using models that consider additional semantic factors to improve accuracy.
- **Multimodal RAG**: Expanding the scope of RAG to include not only textual but also audio and video content, by first transcribing them into text and then embedding for retrieval purposes.

## Misunderstood or Confusing Topics
- **Chunking vs. Vector Embeddings**: Some confusion may arise between chunking as a method to handle large documents versus using vector embeddings for semantic search. It's important to distinguish these two concepts, with chunking being about dividing content into smaller parts and vector embeddings being used to represent the meaning of that content in numerical form.

This summary captures the essence of how vector embeddings can be effectively utilized across various applications from text-based queries to multimedia data, providing a clear understanding for both practical implementation and theoretical comprehension.
