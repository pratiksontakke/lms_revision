# Lecture Summary: Practical Application of AI Tools in Software Development

## Key Takeaways
1. **Managing Context Windows**: Understand how Cursor operates under constraints with context windows that vary between 250 lines (Normal Mode) and up to 750 lines (Max Mode).
2. **Providing Effective Prompts**: Use relevant project files, markdown descriptions, and screenshots for better code generation or debugging.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose models based on task precision or reasoning needs, with powerful models handling large codebases and thinking-focused models for detailed tasks like test case generation.
4. **Open Source Contributions**: Know how to manage token limitations when working with entire repositories and use system prompts effectively.
5. **Programming Knowledge**: Recognize that while AI tools are helpful, strong programming skills are crucial for interpreting and validating outputs, treating them as junior developers in your supervision.

## Important Concepts
- **Context Window**: Limits the amount of code processed by Cursor at once.
- **Modes (Normal/Max)**: Adjust based on file size to ensure optimal processing within model constraints.
- **Prompt Engineering**: The art and science of crafting effective prompts for Cursor to perform specific tasks like debugging or API integration.
- **Model Selection**: Importance of choosing models suited to the task at hand, balancing power with specificity.
- **Open Source Contributions**: Strategies for handling large repositories within AI model constraints and using system prompts for project exploration.

## Interview-style Questions & Answers
1. **What is the role of context windows in Cursor?**  
   The context window limits the amount of code processed by Cursor at once, with Normal Mode handling up to 250 lines per file and Max Mode capable of processing up to 750 lines through multiple model calls.
   
2. **How can you use markdown files for better prompt generation?**  
   By creating markdown files like `project.md` that detail the project‚Äôs architecture, key entities, and database schema, Cursor is prompted to read these before writing any code, enhancing context-based responses.

3. **Why is programming knowledge essential when using AI coding assistants?**  
   Even with AI tools, strong programming skills are necessary for interpreting and validating outputs, ensuring that the final product aligns with project requirements and maintains quality standards.

4. **What strategies can you use to contribute effectively to open-source projects through AI tools?**  
   Use larger context window AI tools to ingest entire repositories while managing token limitations, employing system prompts for detailed exploration of technology and architecture before any code contributions.

## Misunderstood or Confusing Topics
- **The balance between pure reliance on AI and foundational programming skills**: Some might confuse not relying enough on traditional programming knowledge with potential pitfalls in interpreting AI outputs, emphasizing that while AI tools are beneficial, they should be used as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, solid programming fundamentals.
