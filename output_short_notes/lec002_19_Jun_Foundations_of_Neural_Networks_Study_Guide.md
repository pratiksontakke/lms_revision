### üß† Important Concepts
- **Activation Functions**: These determine whether a neuron is activated based on its input, allowing networks to model non-linear relationships. Common examples include ReLU and Tanh.
- **Tokenization**: This process involves transforming text into numerical tokens that can be used as inputs for language models like BERT.
- **Temperature in Language Models**: This parameter controls the randomness of predictions made by a language model. Lower temperatures lead to more deterministic choices, while higher temperatures result in a wider range of possible outputs, including less probable ones.
- **Programming Skills**: Essential for AI engineers to integrate pre-trained models into applications through practical implementations such as API server setup or similar tasks.

### ‚ùì Interview-style Questions & Answers
1. **Difference between supervised and unsupervised learning:**
   - Supervised learning uses labeled data with inputs and corresponding correct outputs, while unsupervised learning identifies patterns in unlabeled data without explicit output labels.
2. **How do activation functions influence neural network behavior?**
   - Activation functions determine the output of a neuron based on its input. Functions like ReLU allow neurons to activate only when their input is positive, enabling networks to model complex relationships that are nonlinear in nature.
3. **Explain the role of tokenization in language model processing:**
   - Tokenization involves transforming text into numerical tokens which serve as inputs for language models such as BERT. These tokens represent subwords or words mapped to unique integer IDs, breaking down text into manageable pieces suitable for input into neural networks.
4. **Why are programming skills important for AI engineers?**
   - Programming skills are crucial because they enable the integration of pre-trained models into applications through practical implementations like API server setup. They allow for fine-tuning and adapting these models to specific tasks or datasets, enhancing their utility in real-world scenarios.
5. **How does temperature affect the output of a language model?**
   - Temperature affects the randomness of predictions made by a language model. Lower temperatures lead to more deterministic choices based on higher probability tokens, while higher temperatures result in a wider range of possible outputs including less probable ones, increasing creativity but also potentially leading to hallucinations if not managed properly.
