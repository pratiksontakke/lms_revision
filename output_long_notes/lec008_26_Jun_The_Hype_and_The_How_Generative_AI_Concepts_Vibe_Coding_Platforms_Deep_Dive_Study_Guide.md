**Human: Technical Note-Taker**
=============================

### Introduction to LLMs (Large Language Models)

* Definition: Large language models are AI systems that process and generate human-like text.
* Characteristics:
	+ Can understand natural language
	+ Can generate coherent text
	+ Can be trained on large datasets

### Function Calling in LLMs

* **Multiple Function Calls Handling**: Some user queries require calling multiple functions/tools, such as asking for weather information and performing mathematical calculations together.
* **Error Handling and Safety Checks**: Since LLMs might sometimes use incorrect function names or pass wrong parameters, robust error handling is crucial.
* **Structured Output Using Function Calling**: LLMs can be instructed to output data in a structured way using function calling, often guided by schemas similar to JSON Schema.

### Mixture of Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models

* Definition: MoE is an architecture technique where multiple smaller expert models exist within a large model.
* Characteristics:
	+ Reduces memory consumption and improves inference speed without compromising performance
	+ Experts specialize in subtle tasks like understanding grammar, idioms, or other linguistic aspects

### Quantization of LLMs

* Definition: Quantization refers to reducing the precision of model parameters (weights) to compress the model and enable faster inference on restricted hardware.
* Characteristics:
	+ Converts floating point values (e.g., FP32) to smaller integer formats (e.g., INT8 or INT4)
	+ Leads to reduced model size and faster computation due to simpler arithmetic
	+ Comes at the cost of some accuracy degradation

### LLM Distillation (Knowledge Distillation)

* Definition: LLM distillation is the process of transferring knowledge from a large 'teacher' model to a smaller 'student' model.
* Characteristics:
	+ The large model generates outputs or synthetic datasets.
	+ The smaller model is trained (fine-tuned) to mimic the teacher's behavior, either using synthetic data or by matching output probabilities.

### Model Formats: GGML, GGUF, GPTQ, ONNX, SafeTensor

* Definition: Different formats exist for storing and running machine learning models.
* Characteristics:
	+ GGML: Older format optimized for CPU inference.
	+ GGUF: Newer format used by models like O-LAMA, optimized for CPU & GPU.
	+ GPTQ: Format optimized for GPU execution and quantized models.
	+ ONNX: Open Neural Network Exchange format enabling model portability across frameworks (e.g., PyTorch to TensorFlow).
	+ SafeTensor: Format focused on safety and integrity while loading models; preferred by Hugging Face for preventing code execution vulnerabilities.

### LLM Inference Calculators

* Definition: LLM inference calculators help estimate resource requirements (GPU RAM, CPU, system RAM, latency) based on model size and quantization.
* Characteristics:
	+ Inputs include model parameter count, quantization level (e.g., Q4, Q8, FP16), context length (maximum tokens), and hardware specs.
	+ Outputs estimated requirements for memory, GPU count, and expected latency.

### Benchmarks and Evaluation of LLMs

* Definition: Benchmarks help evaluate the performance of LLMs across different tasks.
* Characteristics:
	+ Public benchmarks like LM Arena and Chatbot Arena gather user votes on model responses.
	+ Hugging Face hosts leaderboard rankings based on quantitative metrics.
	+ User-based voting helps judge the usefulness and presentation quality.

### Stable Diffusion Overview

* Definition: Stable Diffusion is a generative AI model primarily used for image generation.
* Characteristics:
	+ Generates images by iterative denoising of random noise.
	+ The model has been trained on paired examples of noisy images and expected clear images.
	+ The diffusion process cleans the noise step-by-step until the final image emerges.

### Overview of Vibe-Coding Platforms

* Definition: Various AI-powered platforms exist to accelerate frontend and full-stack development.
* Characteristics:
	+ Lovable: Focused on frontend creation; allows editing specific page elements interactively.
	+ Bolt: Offers more control, supports mobile app development.
	+ Replit: Online IDE with support for entire application development but slower for large apps.
	+ V0 (VREL): Task-based development with better control and autonomy.

### Optimizing Prompts for AI Platforms

* Definition: Each AI platform requires prompts tailored to its expected input style.
* Characteristics:
	+ General prompts may perform poorly; optimize prompts considering platform specific system prompts and best practices.
	+ Use search engines or LLMs themselves to refine/modulate prompts for platforms like Lovable.

### Practical Coding and Using Tools like Cursor

* Definition: To effectively leverage AI and tools like Cursor for software development, have fundamental coding skills, including proficiency in Python and software engineering principles.
* Characteristics:
	+ Learn backend development, REST API building (e.g., FastAPI), error handling, OOP concepts.
	+ Use Cursor to speed up coding tasks but understand the code generated; do not rely on it blindly.
	+ Debugging skills are crucial; generated code might have errors or inefficiencies.
