**Introduction to Multimodal RAG**
=============================

Multimodal RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) extends traditional text-based RAG to support multiple data types such as text, images, and tables. Unlike traditional RAG that works only with text, multimodal RAG can process unstructured documents that include images and tables, extract and chunk these elements while maintaining context, generate vector embeddings for them, and retrieve relevant information based on user queries.

**Challenges in Multimodal RAG**
=============================

Traditional RAG focuses on text and struggles when documents include other modalities such as images and tables, especially when they're embedded in PDFs or similar formats. Key challenges include:

* Extracting heterogeneous data types (text, tables, images) from documents.
* Chunking such heterogeneous data while maintaining semantic relationships.
* Generating embeddings that accurately represent different modalities.
* Efficiently retrieving contextually relevant chunks based on queries.
* Maintaining context is difficult if related text and tables are treated separately without linkage, leading to inaccurate retrieval.

**Data Extraction Using the Unstructured Library**
=============================================

To extract text, images, and tables from unstructured documents like PDFs, the lecture recommends using the unstructured library, which properly maintains visual layout and content relationships.

* Other libraries like PyPDF2, PDFPlumber, PyMuPDF, Tabula, and Camelot are alternatives for text or heavy table extraction.
* Unstructured supports chunking by title, which allows grouping all elements (text, images, tables) under sections or chapters to maintain context.
* Example usage of unstructured to extract PDF elements:
```python
from unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf

# Extract chunks by title, images, tables
chunks = partition_pdf(
    filename="document.pdf",
    include_tables=True,
    include_images=True,
    chunking_strategy="by_title"
)

# chunks now contains a list of composite elements including text blocks, images, and tables
```
This method preserves the hierarchical structure, allowing later processing to maintain context.

**Chunking Strategy Based on Titles**
=====================================

Rather than arbitrary text chunking, chunking based on titles or section headers preserves semantic context and relationships among elements within a section.

* For example, if a chapter contains text paragraphs, tables, and images, all these elements are grouped into one chunk rather than scattered across separate chunks. This allows retrieval to be more relevant and contextually accurate.
* Illustration:
```markdown
Chunk 1: Introduction (text, images, tables related to intro)
Chunk 2: Methodology (all content in methodology section)
Chunk 3: Results
```
When the user queries about 'Methodology', the retrieval will return all relevant text, images, and tables within that chunk.

**Generating Summaries for Each Modality**
==========================================

To reduce the size and retain relevant context, summaries are generated separately for text, tables, and images using specialized models.

* Text and table summaries are generated using a lightweight language model like LLaMA 3 or similar.
* For images, a vision language model (e.g., GPT-4o Mini via Grog API) is used to describe or summarize the image content.
* Summaries act as condensed representations used for embedding generation and retrieval.

**Example of prompting an LLM for text summary:**
```python
summary_prompt = '''You are an assistant tasked with summarizing the tables and text. Provide a concise summary without additional commentary.'''
summary = llm.generate(summary_prompt + input_text)
```
**Example of image summarization prompt:**
```python
image_prompt = '''Describe the image in detail. The image is part of a research paper explaining Transformer architecture. Be specific about graphs.'''
summary = vision_llm.generate(image_prompt + base64_encoded_image)
```
This approach ensures that all content modalities are meaningfully represented.

**Encoding and Storage with Vector Databases**
=============================================

Instead of saving raw content, the system generates embeddings from the modality summaries and stores these embeddings in a vector database to facilitate efficient semantic search.

* The lecture uses ChromaDB as the vector store with in-memory storage for demonstration.
* Embeddings are generated using OpenAI embedding models imported from langchain.embeddings.
* Each chunk or element is assigned a unique ID using a UID generator to link the summary embedding stored in the vector store with the original raw content stored separately.

**Example code snippet for adding documents to vector store:**
```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
import uuid

embeddings_model = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
vector_store = Chroma(collection_name="multimodal", embedding_function=embeddings_model)

documents = [
    {"page_content": summary, "metadata": {"doc_id": str(uuid.uuid4())}}
    for summary in text_summaries
]

vector_store.add_documents(documents)
```
The original content is linked via the unique IDs for retrieval.

**Retrieval and RAG Pipeline Construction**
==========================================

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline fetches relevant chunks based on user queries using their vector embeddings and generates responses via an LLM.

* The retrieval process calculates similarity between user query embeddings and summary embeddings stored in the vector database.
* Retrieved chunks' unique IDs are used to fetch original content from a document store for accurate response generation.
* The response is generated by passing both the user query and the retrieved context to an LLM.

**Example pseudocode of retrieval and response generation:**
```python
retrieved_docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(user_query)
context_text = build_context_from_docs(retrieved_docs)
response = llm.generate(f"Context: {context_text}\nQuestion: {user_query}")
print(response)
```
This multi-layer retrieval ensures relevant context is utilized.

**Handling Images as Base64 and Decoding for Display**
=====================================================

Images extracted from PDFs are converted to base64 strings for embedding and storage. When showing results, these base64 encoded images are decoded back and rendered appropriately.

* Base64 encoding converts binary image data into ASCII string representation suitable for storage and transfer.
* Decoding converts stored base64 strings back into image format for display.

**Example base64 image encoding and decoding:**
```python
import base64

# Encoding an image to base64
with open('image.png', 'rb') as img_file:
    b64_string = base64.b64encode(img_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

# Decoding base64 back to bytes
img_bytes = base64.b64decode(b64_string)

# For web display, use:
img_src = f"data:image/png;base64,{b64_string}"
```
This technique allows seamless integration of images in multimodal retrieval results.

**Concurrency and Efficient API Calls for Summarization**
=====================================================

To optimize summarization over multiple chunks, concurrency is used to make multiple API calls in parallel.

* Setting max_concurrency to more than 1 allows simultaneous requests to the LLM or vision model, reducing total processing time.
* However, excessive concurrency may lead to rate-limiting from the API provider.

**Example of concurrency with API calls:**
```python
import asyncio

async def summarize_chunk(chunk):
    return await llm.summarize(chunk)

async def summarize_chunks(chunks):
    tasks = [asyncio.create_task(summarize_chunk(chunk)) for chunk in chunks]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return results

# Running the summarization concurrently
summaries = asyncio.run(summarize_chunks(text_chunks))
```
Balancing concurrency helps optimize speed and avoid errors.

**Best Practices and Learning Philosophy**
=====================================

The lecture emphasizes the importance of hands-on implementation for mastering software concepts like multimodal RAG.

* Theoretical knowledge alone is insufficient; practical coding and debugging build deeper understanding.
* Using AI tools is helpful for assistance but understanding each function and logic is necessary.
* Experimenting with chunking strategies, extraction tools, and summarization models is encouraged for improving results.
* This philosophy applies broadly to software development and machine learning, where building projects solidifies comprehension.
