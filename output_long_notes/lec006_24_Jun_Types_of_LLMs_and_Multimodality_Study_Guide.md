### Technical Considerations: Inference, Attention Heads, Tokenization, Context Window

Inference:

Model generating output (not training). Slower with larger models or longer inputs due to quadratic attention cost (O(n²)).

Attention Heads:

Multiple “attention heads” help the model focus on different aspects of input (syntax, coreference, etc.). More heads = richer understanding but higher compute.

Tokenization & Token Limits:

Text is split into tokens (sub-word units). Models have a context window (e.g., 4k, 32k, 100k tokens). Long prompts must fit in this limit, or older tokens are dropped.

Context Window:

The total number of tokens a model can see (input + output). Bigger windows support longer inputs but cost more and may have diminishing returns.

Open vs Proprietary Models:

Open-weight models (e.g., LLaMA 2) = downloadable, customizable, self-hostable.

Proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) = accessed via API only, often more capable but less flexible.

Trade-off: control & privacy vs performance & ease of use.

### Bottom Line

Understanding inference cost, attention mechanics, token limits, and model types (open vs closed) is key to building efficient, powerful LLM applications. The field is evolving fast, but these fundamentals stay relevant.

### Example Prompts for Reduced Hallucination:

Q: Who will win a fight between a white duck and a blackbird? Answer only if you are certain; otherwise, say you don’t know.
The answer might then be "I am not sure" instead of hallucinating a winner.

### Structured Output in LLMs Using Langchain and Pydantic

Structured output refers to formatting LLM responses into a specific schema or JSON format desirable for downstream processing. This is crucial in production applications where responses must comply with predefined structures.

Langchain supports structured output by integrating with Pydantic models to define the response schema.
It leverages LLMs with tool/function calling capabilities to enforce this structured format.
If the LLM fails to comply with the output format, errors can be caught, and prompts reissued to ensure reliable structured data.

Example: Suppose we want to classify a customer support ticket into categories and priority with a summary:

from pydantic import BaseModel
from langchain.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser

class SupportTicket(BaseModel):
    category: str  # e.g. billing, technical, sales, general
    priority: str  # low, medium, high, critical
    summary: str

parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=SupportTicket)

prompt = f"Classify the ticket with category, priority, and summary in JSON format as per {parser.get_format_instructions()}"
The LLM then returns a JSON-conformant string, parsed as a Python object for downstream tasks.

### Prompt Collection and Generation Strategies

Maintaining a prompt library is beneficial for reusing and improving prompts for different tasks.

Experienced prompt engineers curate and optimize prompts over time resulting in reliable outputs.
Tools such as OpenAI’s meta prompt and reasoning LLMs help generate or enhance prompts automatically.
Searching platforms like Perplexity and Reddit for top-rated prompts can inspire effective prompt formulations.

Example: Using OpenAI’s meta prompt to improve a summarization prompt:

meta_prompt = "Improve the following prompt for better summary generation: {user_prompt}"
One can pass their user prompt to this meta prompt and generate a refined version.

### Limitations and Best Practices Using LLMs

Important guidelines when using LLMs include:

Avoid relying on LLMs for precise mathematical computations or accounting tasks.
Limit context length to relevant information to prevent confusion and reduce token costs.
Long, unsegmented conversations lead to forgetting or mixing up context.
Use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide concise, relevant context.
Avoid blindly trusting AI-generated code or fixes; verify and edit prompts rather than iteratively asking for fixes in the same chat.

Example practice: Split a long chat into sessions and provide a summary at the start of each new session to refresh context.

### Multi-modality in LLMs

Multimodal LLMs can process and generate multiple data types, such as text, images, audio, and video, within a single model environment.

Models like GPT-4o and Gemini support multimodal input/output including text and images, but often lack full video or audio generation capabilities.
The core idea is converting various input modalities (image patches, text tokens) into a unified token vocabulary.
Native image generation integrated within the LLM improves performance over previous methods where image generation was outsourced to separate models like DALL·E 2.

Example: Asking GPT-4o to analyze an image and generate textual content about it in the same interaction:

User: "Analyze this image and describe it in detail."
This interaction relies on the model’s multimodal token understanding capabilities.

During training, images are tokenized differently but mixed with text tokens in the same vocabulary space for unified processing.

### Confidence Scoring and Model Self-assessment

To reduce overconfidence, LLMs can be prompted to provide a confidence score for their outputs, helping users assess reliability.

Confidence scoring is useful in AI applications like code generation where models rate the likelihood of their response being correct.
Asking models to present reasoning or rationales behind their answers also helps evaluate answer quality.

Example Prompt: "Provide a solution for the coding task, rate your confidence in this solution from 0 to 100%, and explain your reasoning."
