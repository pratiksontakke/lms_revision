**Lecture Notes**

### Introduction

* Technical note-taking is an essential skill for developers and engineers.
* The goal of this lecture is to provide a comprehensive overview of backend development using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Pydantic.

### Setting Up the Project

* Create a new project directory and initialize a virtual environment using `python -m venv myenv`.
* Install the required dependencies: `pip install fastapi sqlalchemy pydantic`.
* Create a new file called `main.py` to define the FastAPI application.

### Defining API Routes with FastAPI

* Use the `@router.get` or `@router.post` decorators to define endpoints.
* Define routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) operations.
* Use Pydantic schemas as request bodies and response models for validation and serialization.

### Handling Pagination in API

* Implement pagination using the `skip` and `limit` parameters.
* Use the `offset` and `limit` methods to fetch data page by page efficiently.

### Creating Database Tables at Application Startup

* Define a function called `create_tables` to create database tables automatically if they don't exist.
* Use the `@app.on_event('startup')` event to call the `create_tables` function on application startup.

### Relationships Between Tables in SQLAlchemy ORM

* Define relationships between tables using the `relationship()` and `ForeignKey()` methods.
* Implement one-to-many and many-to-many relationships using SQLAlchemy's ORM features.

### Best Practices and Rationale in Backend Design

* Separate concerns to prevent tightly coupled code.
* Use controllers/routes to handle API contracts, but keep business logic details separate.
* Encapsulate database interactions in a CRUD/service layer for easier modifications and testing.
* Facilitate code reuse through modular design and API versioning.

### Additional Notes and Tips

* Use tools like ChatGPT or Stack Overflow to recall commands.
* Manage dependencies using `requirements.txt` files.
* Properly comment and document your code for maintainability.
* Implement pagination and other API features thoughtfully to enhance performance and client experience.
* Add validators in Pydantic schemas to enforce complex business rules on input data.

### Conclusion

* Backend development is a critical aspect of software engineering.
* FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Pydantic provide powerful tools for building scalable and maintainable backend applications.
* By following best practices and implementing thoughtful design decisions, you can create robust and efficient backends that meet the needs of your users.
