### A. Neural Networks

#### 1. Weights and Learning

* In neural networks, connections between neurons have associated weights, numerical values initially set randomly.
* Weights modify the strength and sign of the input signals.
* During training, these weights are adjusted to minimize error in predictions.

Example: Simplified weight update step in training
```python
learning_rate = 0.1
error = target_output - predicted_output
weights += learning_rate * error * inputs
```

#### 2. Activation Functions

* Decide whether a neuron is activated based on its input.
* Common activations: Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh.
* Allow networks to model non-linear relationships.

Example:
```python
import numpy as np
def relu(x):
    return np.maximum(0, x)

inputs = np.array([-1.0, 0.5, 2.0])
weights = np.array([0.7, -1.2, 0.5])
output = relu(np.dot(inputs, weights))
print(output)
```

### B. Language Models

#### 1. Tokenization and Tokens

* Text data is transformed into numerical tokens before being input to language models.
* Tokens represent subwords or words mapped to unique integer IDs.
* Tokenization breaks text into manageable pieces.

Example:
```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
text = "The cat sat on the mat."
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
token_ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens)
print(tokens)
print(token_ids)
```

#### 2. Probability Distribution and Temperature

* Language model predicts a probability for each possible next token.
* The token with highest probability is the likeliest next word.
* Temperature parameter controls randomness in the choice of next token.

Example: Simplified token sampling with temperature
```python
import numpy as np

def sample_token(probabilities, temperature=1.0):
    adjusted_probs = np.power(probabilities, 1/temperature)
    adjusted_probs /= np.sum(adjusted_probs)
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=adjusted_probs)

probs = np.array([0.7, 0.2, 0.1])  # example probabilities
print(sample_token(probs, temperature=0.5))  # Low temp, likely token 0
print(sample_token(probs, temperature=2.0))  # High temp, more randomness
```

### C. Limitations and Challenges

#### 1. Bias in Training Data

* Models learn biases present in training datasets, causing biased or unfair outputs.

Example: A chatbot might use a neural model for language understanding but symbolic rules for enforcing business logic.

#### 2. Hallucination

* The model may generate plausible but incorrect outputs due to prediction-based nature.

Example:
```python
import numpy as np

def sample_token(probabilities, temperature=1.0):
    adjusted_probs = np.power(probabilities, 1/temperature)
    adjusted_probs /= np.sum(adjusted_probs)
    return np.random.choice(len(probabilities), p=adjusted_probs)

probs = np.array([0.7, 0.2, 0.1])  # example probabilities
print(sample_token(probs, temperature=2.0))  # High temp, more randomness
```

### D. Role of Programming and Engineering Skills

#### 1. Strong programming and software engineering skills are critical.

Example: Implementing an API server that uses a pre-trained AI model
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from transformers import pipeline

app = FastAPI()
classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')

@app.post('/predict')
async def predict_sentiment(text: str):
    result = classifier(text)
    return {'label': result[0]['label'], 'score': result[0]['score']}
```

### E. Conclusion

* Neural networks and language models are powerful tools for AI applications.
* Understanding the limitations and challenges of these technologies is crucial for effective engineering.

Example: A chatbot might use a neural model for language understanding but symbolic rules for enforcing business logic.
