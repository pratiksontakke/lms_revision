# Introduction to Deep Learning

## What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns and relationships from data.

## Why Deep Learning?

* Can learn features automatically, reducing need for manual feature engineering
* Can handle large datasets and high-dimensional data
* Can be used for various applications such as image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, etc.

# Basic Components of Neural Networks

## Artificial Neurons (Nodes)

Artificial neurons are the building blocks of neural networks. Each node receives one or more inputs, performs a computation on those inputs, and then sends the output to other nodes.

### Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns. Common activation functions include:

* Sigmoid: maps input to a value between 0 and 1
* ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): maps input to 0 if negative, and input otherwise
* Tanh: maps input to a value between -1 and 1

## Weights and Biases

Weights are the connections between nodes that determine how much each node contributes to the output. Biases are constants added to the weighted sum of inputs.

### Forward Propagation

Forward propagation is the process of passing input data through the neural network layers to produce an output.

Steps:

* Input features are supplied to the input layer
* Each node computes the weighted sum plus bias
* Activation function is applied to compute the node's output
* This output becomes the input to the next layer
* The process continues until the output layer produces the final prediction

# Training Neural Networks

## Loss Functions

Loss functions measure how far the model's predicted outputs are from the actual outputs. Common loss functions include:

* Mean Squared Error (MSE): for regression tasks
* Cross Entropy Loss: for classification tasks

### Back Propagation

Back propagation is the process by which the neural network updates the weights and biases to minimize the loss.

Steps:

* Calculate loss from actual and predicted outputs
* Compute gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias (using calculus - chain rule)
* Update weights and biases in the direction that reduces the loss (gradient descent)

## Optimizers

Optimizers are algorithms that update weights to minimize the loss function. Common optimizers include:

* Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): basic optimizer using gradients to update weights
* Adam: adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm widely used in deep learning

# Deep Learning Frameworks

Popular frameworks provide prebuilt components like tensors, layers, and optimizers to build and train deep learning models easily. Some popular frameworks include:

* TensorFlow: developed by Google, widely used in industry, supports large-scale deployment
* PyTorch: developed by Facebook, preferred for research and easier debugging
* Keras: high-level API supporting TensorFlow backend

# Deep Learning Architectures

Different architectures are optimized for specific data types and tasks. Some popular architectures include:

* Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): basic fully connected feedforward network, used for tabular data
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): extract spatial features from images using convolutional filters; widely used in image classification and object detection
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): process sequential data step-by-step, used for time series and text
* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): improved version of RNNs to remember long-term dependencies
* Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU): simplified version of LSTM
* Transformers: use self-attention to process entire sequences in parallel; currently state-of-the-art for NLP tasks (e.g., BERT, GPT)

# Applications of Deep Learning

Deep learning is applied in various real-world domains. Some examples include:

* Healthcare: tumor detection using CNNs
* Finance: fraud detection using LSTM
* Retail: recommendation engines
* Natural Language Processing (NLP): language translation and chatbots using Transformers
* Autonomous Vehicles: using CNNs and RNNs for object detection and decision making

# Summary and Key Takeaways

Deep learning uses multi-layer artificial neural networks to learn features automatically. Activation functions introduce non-linearity critical for deep learning performance. Training involves forward propagation and back propagation to update weights. Loss functions measure prediction errors. Hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and epochs control training dynamics. Popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch accelerate model development. Different architectures such as CNNs, RNNs, and transformers are optimized for specific data types and tasks. Understanding basic components of neural networks and their training is fundamental for working in deep learning.
