Here are the full lecture notes on "Technical Note-taking for RAG Systems" in Markdown format:

**Introduction**
===============

* Technical note-taking is a crucial skill for building robust and efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
* This lecture will cover the basics of technical note-taking, focusing on chunking, embeddings, and retrieval.

**Chunking**
==========

* Chunking is the process of dividing documents into smaller units called chunks.
* Chunks can be based on various criteria such as:
	+ Fixed-size chunking: Splits text strictly based on a fixed number of characters.
	+ Recursive chunking: Respects natural language boundaries (paragraphs, sentences, phrases) recursively.
	+ Document-based chunking: Customized chunking for documents with inherent structure (e.g., HTML, Markdown, or code).

**Embeddings**
==========

* Embeddings convert text to numerical vectors capturing semantic meaning.
* OpenAI provides various embedding models:
	+ text-embedding-ada-002 (small and cost-effective)
	+ Previously text-similarity-davinci-001 deprecated
* Open-source alternatives include:
	+ Nomic AI embeddings
	+ BG embeddings
	+ Models on Hugging Face like sentence-transformers

**Retrieval**
==========

* Retrieval is the process of finding relevant chunks based on a user query.
* Similarity metrics measure closeness between embeddings:
	+ Cosine similarity: Measures cosine of angle between vectors; widely used.
	+ Euclidean distance: Straight-line distance between vectors.
	+ Dot product: Unnormalized similarity.
* MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance): A re-ranking algorithm used to reduce redundancy in retrieved chunks.

**RAG Pipeline**
===============

* Documents are chunked intelligently.
* Each chunk is converted to an embedding vector.
* Embeddings along with metadata are stored in a vector database.
* When a user query arrives:
	+ The query is converted to an embedding.
	+ Vector DB is searched for the top-k closest chunks.
	+ Retrieved chunks are combined with a system prompt and user query and passed to LLM to generate an answer.

**Evaluating and Debugging RAG Systems**
=====================================

* Performance: Efficient chunking, indexing, and search.
* Quality: Avoid tiny chunks which carry no meaning; avoid too large chunks.
* Cost: Embedding calls and queries can be expensive. Use cost-saving strategies.
* Security: Manage API keys and sensitive data.
* Monitoring: Maintain warnings for abnormal chunk sizes.
* Citation: Provide sources for answers for transparency.

**Debugging Tips**
================

* Verify chunk sizes and boundaries.
* Monitor vector search relevance scores.
* Adjust overlap parameters.

**Use Cases and Assignments Suggested in Lecture**
=====================================================

* Use embeddings as feature vectors.
* Train ML models like logistic regression, decision trees, or KNN classifiers for categorization.
* Classify articles into multiple categories using multinomial logistic regression.
* Fine-tune embeddings for domain-specific jargons like sales.
* Showcase different chunking techniques over various document types.

**Logistic Regression Example**
=============================

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
import numpy as np

X = np.array(embedding_vectors)  # Embedding vectors of articles
Y = np.array(labels)  # Corresponding categories

model = LogisticRegression(multi_class='multinomial', solver='lbfgs')
model.fit(X, Y)

# Prediction
new_embedding = get_embedding(new_article_text)
prediction = model.predict([new_embedding])
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the topics.
