A comprehensive set of lecture notes on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for building a human-like AI assistant! ðŸ¤–

Here's a summary of the key points:

**Introduction to RAG**

* RAG is a technique that combines retrieval and generation to create a more accurate and informative response.
* It involves storing embeddings of documents in a vector database, such as Pinecone, and using these embeddings for similarity search.

**Document Ingestion and Processing**

* Documents can come in various formats (e.g., PDF, DocX).
* Specific loaders/parsers are used to extract text from each format (e.g., PyPDFLoader for PDFs, Docx2txtLoader for DocX files).

**Chunking and Embedding**

* Langchain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter is used to split documents into chunks of fixed size with overlaps.
* Sentence Transformers are used to generate embeddings for each chunk.

**Vector Database (Pinecone)**

* Pinecone is initialized with an API key and environment.
* An index is created, and vectors are upserted using the `upsert` method.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation**

* Relevant document chunks are retrieved using similarity search.
* These chunks are passed as context to a language model (LLM) to generate answers based on the augmented knowledge.

**Streamlit UI for RAG Application**

* Streamlit is used to build a simple web UI for document upload and chat interaction.
* Key UI components include tabs, file uploader, buttons, spinner/loader indicators during processing.

This comprehensive set of notes covers the entire pipeline of building an RAG-based AI assistant. It's a great resource for anyone looking to learn about this technique! ðŸ“š
