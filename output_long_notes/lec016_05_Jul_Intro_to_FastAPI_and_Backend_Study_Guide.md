**What is a Server?**

A server can be understood as a platform or system that fulfills client requests over a network, typically the internet. It listens for requests (usually HTTP requests) sent by clients (such as browsers or other applications), processes those requests, and sends back appropriate responses.

Analogy:

Server → Kitchen
API → Waiter
Client → Customer

The server processes request types such as GET (retrieve data), POST (send data), PUT (update data), DELETE (remove data) which are standardized HTTP methods.

Example: When accessing a website, your browser (client) sends a GET request to the server; the server processes it and sends back the webpage.

**Why Use Servers for Sharing Code or Applications?**

Instead of sending code files to others and asking them to install dependencies and run locally, you can deploy your program on a server. Anyone with internet access can then use the application via a web address without installing anything.

Benefits:

* Centralized code execution
* Easier to share and maintain
* Access from any device with a browser

For example, hosting a Python program on a server enables users to interact with it over HTTP via front-end interfaces without requiring local installs.

**Front End and Back End in Applications**

Front End: The user interface part of an application (what users see and interact with in browsers or apps).

Back End: The server-side logic that processes data, runs business logic, and interacts with databases.

Interaction: Front end sends requests (often through a standardized protocol) to the back end, which processes them and sends responses.

Requests typically follow four methods:

* GET: Retrieve data
* POST: Create new data
* PUT: Update existing data
* DELETE: Remove data

This client-server interaction follows a standard language or protocol to ensure compatibility and clarity.

**Backend Frameworks and Servers**

A backend framework provides a structured way to create backend applications and APIs. Examples include:

* Python: FastAPI, Flask, Django
* Java: Spring Boot
* JavaScript: Express.js

Behind the scenes, a server engine runs these frameworks, listens to ports, and manages incoming requests.

In FastAPI, the server engine commonly used is Uvicorn, an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server capable of handling asynchronous requests efficiently.

Example:

uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000

This command runs the FastAPI app on port 8000 with an auto-reload feature.

**How to Create a Simple Server with FastAPI**

You can set up a simple server in FastAPI with just a few lines of code.

Steps:

* Install dependencies:
pip install fastapi uvicorn
* Create a Python file (e.g., app.py) and write:
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get('/')
async def read_root():
    return {'message': 'Hello, World!'}
* Run the server:
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
* Access http://localhost:8000/ in a browser.

This starts a web server that responds with a simple JSON message.

**Virtual Environments in Python**

A virtual environment is an isolated environment in Python to manage dependencies separately for different projects, preventing conflicts.

Why use virtual environments?

* Different applications may require different library versions
* Avoids system-wide changes

How to create and activate:

python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate      # On Linux/macOS
myenv\Scripts\activate.bat   # On Windows

Exit virtual environment:

deactivate

After activating, you install packages which are limited to this environment.

**FastAPI HTTP Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE**

FastAPI allows you to define endpoints for different HTTP methods:

* GET: Retrieve data from server
* POST: Add new data to server
* PUT: Update existing data
* DELETE: Remove data

Example: API endpoints for item management

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

items_db = {1: "apple", 2: "banana"}

@app.get('/items/{item_id}')
async def read_item(item_id: int):
    if item_id in items_db:
        return {"item_id": item_id, "name": items_db[item_id]}
    return {"error": "Item not found"}

@app.post('/items/{item_id}')
async def create_item(item_id: int, name: str):
    if item_id in items_db:
        return {"error": "Item already exists"}
    items_db[item_id] = name
    return {"message": "Item created successfully"}

@app.put('/items/{item_id}')
async def update_item(item_id: int, name: str):
    if item_id not in items_db:
        return {"error": "Item not found"}
    items_db[item_id] = name
    return {"message": "Item updated successfully"}

@app.delete('/items/{item_id}')
async def delete_item(item_id: int):
    if item_id not in items_db:
        return {"error": "Item not found"}
    del items_db[item_id]
    return {"message": "Item deleted successfully"}

You can test these APIs with tools like Postman or via the built-in Swagger docs at /docs.

**Swagger Documentation in FastAPI**

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI without any extra work.

Access it by navigating to:

http://localhost:8000/docs

Here, you can see all available endpoints, their methods, parameters, and can even try the requests live from the browser.

This provides easy API testing and exploration.

**Pydantic Models in FastAPI for Data Validation**

Pydantic is a powerful library FastAPI uses to validate incoming and outgoing data for endpoints using Python classes.

Benefits of Pydantic:

* Automatic parsing and validation of request bodies
* Clear and concise data models
* Auto-generated API documentation

Example Pydantic Model:

from pydantic import BaseModel

class Item(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    description: str = None  # Optional field
    price: float

Use in FastAPI endpoint:

from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()
items_db = {}

@app.post('/items/')
async def create_item(item: Item):
    if item.id in items_db:
        return {"error": "Item already exists"}
    items_db[item.id] = item
    return {"message": "Item created successfully", "item": item}

Pydantic automatically checks that all required fields are present and data types match, otherwise it sends a validation error response.

**Running Local and Public Servers - Using Ngrok**

Your development server (e.g., FastAPI's UVicorn server) running locally is not accessible over the internet by default.

Localhost server: Runs only on your machine, accessible at localhost or 127.0.0.1.

Making local servers public:

Tools like ngrok create a secure tunnel from a public URL to your local machine.

How ngrok works:

* Run your local server on a port, say 8000
* Run ngrok http 8000
* Ngrok will give a public URL forwarding to your local server

Example:

ngrok http 8000

You get a URL like https://abcd1234.ngrok.io accessible worldwide as long as your local server runs.

This is useful for sharing your work in progress with others or testing webhook integrations.

**Importance of Backend for AI and Generative AI Applications**

When building AI-powered applications (such as chatbots or speech recognition), the backend server often:

* Hosts the AI model or connects to external AI services (e.g., OpenAI API)
* Handles client requests and responses
* Manages data and application logic

Example:

You deploy a Llama or OpenAI model on a server.
Your frontend application sends requests to your backend, which interacts with AI services.
Backend returns processed AI results to frontend for user display.

Knowing backend development lets you deploy AI models, integrate APIs, and expose your AI as a service.
