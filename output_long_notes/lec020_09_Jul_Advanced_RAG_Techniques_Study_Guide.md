**Introduction to LangChain**
==========================

LangChain is a framework that deals with Large Language Models (LLMs) and language workflows known as chains. It abstracts away the inputs and outputs for different LLM providers into a single standardized interface, allowing easy model switching and component replacement.

**Benefits of LangChain**
-------------------------

* Replaceable Components: Every component of LangChain, including models, retrievers, re-ankers, and image models, can be replaced easily to adapt to fast-moving AI advancements.
* Standardized Interfaces: Every component has standard properties (e.g., role, type) making chaining easy and systematic.
* Orchestration: LangChain creates links between components to form complete AI workflows.
* Traceability: Integrated tracing with LangSmith to log inputs and outputs at each component for better debugging and monitoring.

**LangSmith Integration**
-------------------------

LangChain supports integration with LangSmith, which requires setting up an API key and endpoint URL as environment variables. Once enabled (`LANGCHAIN_TRACING_ENABLED=True`), LangChain automatically sends tracing information to LangSmith.

**Example (Environment Variables):**

* `LANGCHAIN_HANDLER=langsmith`
* `LANGCHAIN_TRACING_ENABLED=True`
* `LANGCHAIN_LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
* `LANGCHAIN_LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://YOUR_ENDPOINT.langsmith.com`

**Chat Models and Message Types in LangChain**
------------------------------------------------

LangChain supports multiple chat model providers. When a chat model is invoked, it returns a response with a content field containing the model's output and a metadata field with useful information such as token usage and finish reasons.

* Common Message Types:
	+ HumanMessage: User input message.
	+ AIMessage: Model response.
	+ SystemMessage: System prompts.
	+ ToolMessage: Messages related to tool call results.
	+ RemoveMessage: Used for manipulating chat history (advanced use case).

**Chat History Management in LangChain**
-----------------------------------------

LangChain provides methods to manage chat history efficiently, especially important because context tokens are limited with LLMs.

* Key methods:
	+ Trim Method: Limits chat history either by token count or message count, typically retaining the most recent messages plus system prompts.
	+ Custom Trimming: You can manually compose the message array consisting of latest meaningful messages to control context length explicitly.

**Tool and Tool Calling in LangChain**
-----------------------------------------

Tools are external functions (e.g., weather API, calculator) that the LLM can call during interaction. LangChain simplifies this by:

* Defining Python functions with descriptions (docstrings).
* Decorating them as tools.
* Binding these tools to the LLM.
* When the LLM decides to call a tool, LangChain parses the tool call, extracts arguments, runs the tool function, and feeds results back as tool messages.

**Example (Define and bind tools):**

```python
from langchain.tools import tool
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

@tool
def get_current_time():
    """Return current time"""
    import datetime
    return datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()

llm = ChatOpenAI()
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools([get_current_time])
```

**Structured Output and Output Parsers**
-----------------------------------------

LangChain supports forcing LLM outputs into specific structures using JSON schemas or Pydantic models.

* It converts target data classes into JSON schemas.
* Passes schemas to the LLM as function call parameters.
* LLM replies with structured outputs matching the schema.
* This is useful for parsing complex LLM outputs in a consistent manner.

**Example using Pydantic:**

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from langchain.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser

class PersonInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int
    occupation: str

parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=PersonInfo)

# Now use parser in chain to enforce output structure
```

**Multimodality Support**
-------------------------

LangChain supports multimodal inputs including text, images, and audio.

* Images can be passed as base64 encoded strings or direct URLs, depending on the LLM's support.
* Audio can be converted into base64 strings similarly.
* Supports passing multiple images for tasks such as PDF processing.

**Example (Passing Base64 image):**

```python
image_base64 = 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0...'
messages = [
    {
        'type': 'image_url',
        'value': image_base64
    }
]
# Pass messages to LangChain chat model
```

**Runnable Interface and Running Chains**
-----------------------------------------

Every component in LangChain (LLMs, prompt templates, output parsers, tools) implements a common 'Runnable' interface.

* Each has invoke method to process inputs.
* Supports batch method for parallel processing multiple inputs.
* Supports stream method to get streaming outputs.
* You can convert any custom function to a Runnable using RunnableLambda.

**Example (Custom Runnable):**

```python
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableLambda

def uppercase(text: str) -> str:
    return text.upper()

uppercase_runnable = RunnableLambda(uppercase)
result = uppercase_runnable.invoke('hello')  # Returns 'HELLO'
```

**Chain Composition Using Pipe Operator**
-----------------------------------------

LangChain supports composing multiple Runnables into a chain using the pipe (|) operator.

* The output of one component becomes the input of the next.
* Example:

```python
uppercase_runnable = RunnableLambda(lambda x: x.upper())
add_prefix_runnable = RunnableLambda(lambda x: f"Result: {x}")

chain = uppercase_runnable | add_prefix_runnable
result = chain.invoke('hello')  # Returns 'Result: HELLO'
```

**Batch and Parallel Processing**
--------------------------------

Runnables can process multiple inputs concurrently.

* batch method takes a list of inputs and returns a list of outputs.
* RunnableParallel lets you run multiple chains or runnables concurrently, returning their results as a dictionary.

**Example (Batch processing):**

```python
inputs = ['hello', 'world']
results = uppercase_runnable.batch(inputs)  # ['HELLO', 'WORLD']
```

**Example (RunnableParallel):**

```python
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableParallel

parallel_runner = RunnableParallel(joke_chain=chain1, fact_chain=chain2)
results = parallel_runner.invoke('input text')
# results = {'joke_chain': joke_result, 'fact_chain': fact_result}
```

**Error Handling and Fallback Chains**
-----------------------------------------

LangChain recommends using try/except blocks for error handling during chain execution.

* Fallback chains can be defined to execute alternative chains if the primary chain fails.
* Example:

```python
try:
    result = main_chain.invoke(input)
except Exception:
    result = fallback_chain.invoke(input)
```

**Assignments Overview**
-------------------------

Several assignments were discussed to practice various LangChain capabilities:

* Intelligent Email Response System: Using prompt caching and batch processing.
* Real-time Stock Market Chat: Using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with vector databases.
* Smart Code Tutor: Integrating a full-stack code editor, code interpreter (e.g., E2B), and rag-based documentation retrieval for intelligent explanations.

Students were advised to discuss workload and schedule with the coordinators due to the intensity of assignments.
