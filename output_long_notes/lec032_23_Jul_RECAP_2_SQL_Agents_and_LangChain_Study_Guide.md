**Introduction to SQL Agents**
=============================

SQL agents act as intermediaries allowing users to query structured data using natural language instead of traditional SQL commands. They are particularly useful for non-technical users like marketing, sales, or HR teams who want to extract insights from databases without writing SQL queries.

**Challenges in Querying Structured Data**
=====================================

Structured data in relational databases consists of multiple tables with various relationships between them. Extracting meaningful data often requires complex SQL queries involving joins, filters, and groupings.

* Large e-commerce platforms can have dozens to hundreds of tables.
* Maintaining relationships and writing optimized queries over such large schemas is difficult.
* Converting entire structured data into embeddings for semantic search is non-trivial because of these relationships.
* Hence, SQL agents need intelligent methods to filter relevant tables and generate suitable queries.

**Use Cases of SQL Agents**
=====================

SQL Agents enable querying data via natural language allowing non-technical users to gain insights without knowing SQL.

* Example use case: "Can you show me the sales for product X in Q4?"
* Instead of relying on data teams to create numerous dashboards, users can just ask queries directly.
* SQL agents convert natural language into SQL queries and fetch results dynamically.
* Companies like Snowflake, Google, Microsoft, and startups like Vana AI are working on tools that convert natural language queries into accurate SQL commands.

**Approaches to Implement SQL Agents**
=====================================

There are multiple approaches to building SQL agents:

* Direct Approach: Pass the entire database schema (all tables and columns) to the language model (LLM) for query generation.
* This is inefficient and non-scalable due to large contexts.
* Example: Passing all 90 tables and their columns from a large database overloads the model.
* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) / Semantic Search Approach:
	+ Store table names and perhaps column info as embeddings in a vector store.
	+ When the user inputs a query, embed it and find the top-K relevant tables based on similarity.
	+ Pass only these relevant tables to the LLM for query generation and execution.
* Custom Organizational Tools: Build specific SQL agents fine-tuned for your organization's database schema.
	+ This can handle complex queries more accurately but is less general.

**Vector Store and Semantic Search for Table Selection**
=====================================================

To handle large schemas, the system transforms each table name into a vector embedding using a Google Gen.I embedding model.

* Each table name is treated as a document.
* The embeddings are stored in a vector database (like Faiss).
* When a user query comes in, it too is embedded.
* A similarity search is performed in the vector store to find the top-k tables most semantically relevant to the user's query.
* This prevents passing the entire schema context to the LLM, improving efficiency and relevance.

**LangChain SQL Database Toolkit and Agent**
=====================================

LangChain offers a SQL Database Toolkit that facilitates interaction with SQL databases using language models.

* It extracts schema and table info internally.
* Generates SQL queries from natural language prompts via LLMs.
* Executes those queries and returns results.
* Provides validations (read-only policy to prevent harmful commands).
* The core is creating an SQL agent by passing in the LLM and the database connection (SQLAlchemy engine or URI).

**Stepwise Query Processing Using SQL Agent**
=====================================

The SQL Agent operates in a stepwise manner to handle complex queries:

1. Identify relevant tables from user's query using semantic search on embeddings.
2. Determine join conditions if query involves multiple tables.
3. Generate a base SQL query combining the relevant tables.
4. Add filters, grouping, ordering as needed.
5. Validate the generated query to be read-only and safe.

**SQLite Setup and Database Preparation**
=====================================

For demonstration, a local SQLite database with e-commerce dataset tables (customers, orders, products, reviews, sellers, etc.) is set up.

* Data is retrieved from Kaggle datasets such as Zepto or Blanket.
* Data cleaning scripts preprocess raw CSVs to create consistent and relational tables.
* Tables are imported into SQLite using SQL commands or scripts.
* SQLite CLI or tools like DB Browser can be used to explore tables and verify schemas.

**Streamlit Web App Integration**
=====================

A Streamlit app acts as the UI layer for interacting with the SQL agent.

* Users input natural language queries via Streamlit input widgets.
* Backend logic calls the SQL agent to process queries and returns results.
* Relevant tables detected are displayed for transparency.
* Rate limiting can be optionally implemented to prevent API abuse.

**Assignment and Learning Objectives**
=====================================

The lecture concludes with a challenging assignment: Build a multi-database SQL agent workflow.

* Collect and clean datasets from Kaggle (Zepto, Blanket, etc.).
* Load data into multiple SQL databases (or schema).
* Research and implement database connection pooling to interact efficiently with multiple DB instances.
* Implement agents that can understand relationships in different schemas.
* Use LangChain SQL Database Toolkit and vector-store based table selection.

This assignment aims to:

* Strengthen data science skills like cleaning and preprocessing.
* Teach practical database management (connection pooling).
* Deepen understanding of natural language to SQL translation.
* Understanding these fundamentals equips learners to build robust SQL agents in real-world applications.
