**Introduction to LangGraph and AI Engineering Context**
=====================================================

LangGraph is a Python library for building AI applications using graph-based workflows where nodes are functions, edges define the flow of execution, and state represents shared memory across nodes.

The lecture begins with an overview of the AI engineering landscape, emphasizing the high demand for AI engineers who combine software engineering and data science skills. It highlights that AI is integrated into most products today and understanding AI engineering tools like LangGraph is highly valuable.

**Core Components of LangGraph: State, Nodes, and Edges**
=====================================================

LangGraph primarily consists of three components:

* **State**: A shared memory object that flows through the graph, accessible by all nodes.
* **Nodes**: Functions that receive the current state, perform computations or logic, and return an updated state.
* **Edges**: Connections defining the flow between nodes.

**Creating and Managing Graphs in LangGraph**
=============================================

After defining nodes and state, you initialize a StateGraph in LangGraph by passing the state schema, add nodes, connect them using edges, set entry point, compile, and run the graph.

Example: Creating a Simple Graph
--------------------------------

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, End, Start

graph = StateGraph(state_type=GraphState)

# Adding nodes
graph.add_node("node1", node_one)

# Connecting nodes (in this simple graph, node1 leads directly to End)
graph.add_edge("node1", End)

# Setting start node
graph.add_edge(Start, "node1")

# Compile the graph
graph.compile()

# Run the graph with initial state
final_state = graph.invoke({'message': '', 'count': 0, 'processed': False})
print(final_state)
```

**Working with State in LangGraph**
=====================================

State in LangGraph is a dictionary-like object conforming to a schema defined by TypedDict, dataclass, or Pydantic models.

Example: Using Dataclasses for State with Default Values
---------------------------------------------------

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class GraphState:
    message: str = ""
    count: int = 0
    processed: bool = False

# Initialize
initial_state = GraphState()
```

**Conditional Edges for Decision Making**
==========================================

LangGraph supports conditional edges which allow the graph to choose different paths based on the current state values.

Example: Conditional Edge Based on Count
-----------------------------------------

```python
def decision_func(state: GraphState) -> str:
    if state['count'] < 2:
        return "path_a"
    else:
        return "path_b"

# Add nodes and conditional edge
graph.add_node("decision", decision_node)
graph.add_node("path_a", path_a_node)
graph.add_node("path_b", path_b_node)

graph.add_edge("decision", "path_a", condition=decision_func)
graph.add_edge("decision", "path_b", condition=decision_func)

# Entry point
graph.add_edge(Start, "decision")
```

**Reducers and State Aggregation**
=====================================

When nodes run, especially in parallel, all nodes might update the same state keys (e.g., a message string). But simple assignment leads to overwriting.

Example: Using add_message Reducer
---------------------------------

```python
from typing import Annotated, List
from langgraph.state.reducers import add_message

class GraphState(TypedDict):
    message: Annotated[str, add_message]
    count: int
    processed: bool
```

**Using Special Nodes: Start and End**
=====================================

LangGraph provides special nodes to mark the beginning and end of a graph:

* **Start**: The entry point of the graph.
* **End**: Marks termination points.

Example: Defining Start and End Nodes in a Graph
---------------------------------------------------

```python
from langgraph.graph import Start, End

graph.add_edge(Start, "node1")
graph.add_edge("node3", End)
```

**Visualization with Mermaid**
=============================

LangGraph supports generating visual diagrams of the graph using Mermaid, a diagramming tool.

Example: Visualizing the Graph
-----------------------------

```python
mermaid_str = graph.draw_mermaid()
print(mermaid_str)  # Mermaid syntax for graph visualization
```

**LangSmith Integration for Tracing and Debugging**
=====================================================

LangSmith is a platform integrated with LangGraph for:

* Tracing graph and chain executions.
* Viewing inputs, outputs, and errors per node.
* Analyzing latencies and setting alerts for failures.
* Versioning prompts and managing prompt repositories.

Example: Setting Environment Variables and API Key
---------------------------------------------------

```python
import os

os.environ['LANGSMITH_API_KEY'] = 'your_api_key_here'
```

**Best Practices and Advanced Notes**
=====================================

Use TypedDict, dataclass, or Pydantic to define state schema. Pydantic offers validation and defaults.

Use reducers when multiple nodes update the same state key to prevent data overwrite.

Nodes can have internal local state variables not shared across graph execution.

Conditional edges encapsulate decision logic, enabling dynamic graph execution paths.

Use Start and End nodes for clearly defining graph boundaries.

LangSmith helps in debugging production AI graphs with visual traces, error tracking, and prompt management.

Managing complexity is easier by reusing node functions attached to different nodes.
