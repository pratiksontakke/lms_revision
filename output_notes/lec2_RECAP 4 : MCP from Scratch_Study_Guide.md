# Lecture: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration Guide

## Introduction to the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
The lecture introduces the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized protocol for integrating tools with AI/LLMs. MCP servers abstract tools behind an architecture that includes Tools, Resources, and Prompts in a JSON format. This allows clients to interact with these components without writing custom code for every tool and model.

## Difference Between MCP and Tool Calling with Agents
The lecture explains the difference between integrating tools directly using agents (complex and less portable) and using MCP servers, which abstracts tools behind a standardized protocol, improving interoperability across different LLM clients.

## Setting up Development Environment with UV Package Manager
uv is recommended as a Python package manager for its faster performance compared to pip. The lecture provides installation instructions for uv on Windows and macOS systems and verifies the installation using `uv --version`. It also explains how to initialize an MCP project and add dependencies using uv commands.

## Building a Basic MCP Server Using Python SDK
The Python SDK simplifies building MCP servers, allowing easy creation of tools, resources, and prompts in standardized JSON format. The lecture provides examples for adding simple addition and subtraction tools to the server. It also explains how to run the server using `uv run main.py`.

## Integrating MCP Server with Clients (Cloud Desktop, Cursor)
The lecture details steps to connect an MCP server with clients like Cloud Desktop or Cursor. This includes adding configuration entries in JSON format and restarting the client if necessary. The example config entry for Cloud Desktop is provided.

## Implementing Custom MCP Servers: Example with GitHub Integration
The lecture provides a practical example of building an MCP server that interacts with the GitHub API, including tools to list repositories and handle authorization using personal access tokens. It emphasizes the importance of having appropriate scopes for these tokens.

## Testing MCP Servers Using MCP Inspector
MCP Inspector is a tool used to test and debug MCP servers by interacting with their resources, prompts, and tools via a UI. The lecture explains how to run the inspector and connect it to an MCP server using command-line arguments.

## Building MCP Clients Using Langchain MCP Adapters
The lecture discusses building custom MCP clients using Langchain MCP adapters in Python, including a code snippet for creating a multi-server MCP client and initializing a Langchain agent with OpenAI LLM.

3. üìå **Revision Notes**  
* Model Context Protocol (MCP) - A standardized protocol to integrate tools with AI/LLMs without writing custom code for every tool and model.
* Tools, Resources, Prompts - Core components of an MCP server: functions or endpoints that perform specific tasks; data endpoints like GET requests providing data to LLMs; reusable templates or prompts for LLM interactions.
* GitHub Integration Example - A practical example of building a custom MCP server with tools calling GitHub API endpoints using personal access tokens and implementing functionalities such as listing repositories, creating issues, etc.
* Practical Tips & Considerations: Ensure the MCP server is running for client connection; correctly configure paths and commands; ensure personal access tokens have appropriate scopes (read/write); restart clients after configuration changes to reload MCP server info.

4. üß† **Important Concepts**  
* Model Context Protocol (MCP) - A standardized protocol for integrating tools with LLMs, abstracting them behind servers and exposing components in a JSON format.
* UV Package Manager - Recommended over pip due to faster performance; used to initialize projects and add MCP dependencies.
* FastMCP - Python SDK toolkit for building MCP servers easily by declaring tools, resources, and prompts.
* Langchain MCP Adapters - Tools to build custom MCP clients in Python using the Langchain framework.

5. ‚ùì **Interview-style Questions & Answers**  
Q: What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?
A: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol for integrating tools with AI/LLMs, abstracting them behind MCP servers and reducing custom code needed.

Q: How does MCP differ from tool calling using agents?
A: Tool calling with agents involves writing custom code to integrate tools directly with LLM agents, which can become complex and less portable. MCP offers a standardized protocol and architecture where tools are abstracted behind MCP servers, reducing the custom code needed and improving interoperability across different LLM clients.

Q: What is uv package manager? Why is it recommended over pip for MCP-related installations?
A: UV is a Python package manager that offers faster performance compared to pip. It's recommended for MCP-related installations due to its speed and ease of use in initializing projects with necessary dependencies to build MCP servers.

6. üõ†Ô∏è **Practical Setup & Code Snippets**  
* Installing uv on Windows: `Install-UV -Force` (PowerShell command)
* Installing uv on macOS: `brew install uv` or using a shell script.
* Verifying installation with `uv --version`.
* Initializing and adding MCP dependencies with `uv init .` and `uv add mcpclm`.
* Adding tools to the MCP server (Python SDK example): `@mcp.tool async def subtract(a: int, b: int) -> int: return a - b`
* Running an MCP server locally using `uv run main.py`.
* Configuring Cloud Desktop with MCP server settings in JSON format and restarting the client if necessary.
* GitHub MCP tool to list repositories (Python code snippet): `@mcp.tool def list_repositories(username: str) -> list:` ...
